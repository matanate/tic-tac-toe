# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to get three in a row wins. The game board is displayed in the console.

## How to Play
1. Run the script using a Python interpreter: `python tic_tac_toe.py`
2. Players take turns entering their moves by choosing a position (e.g., "a1", "b2").
3. The game continues until a player wins, or it's a draw.
4. After the game ends, you can choose to play again or exit.

## Game Controls

- After each game, you'll be prompted to restart or exit.
